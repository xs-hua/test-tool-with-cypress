# Overview

This is an ui and api test framework using cypress, axios and bdd
- demonstrate api test with public api()
- demonstrate ui test with cypress official page

### Some opinions derived from previous use experience ###
- not compatible enough with CI, test tool(browserstack etc.)
- complex to use
- smaller supporting-community compared with selenium

### Test data resides in **/fixtures/** ###
customized cypress functions locate in /support/*
possible .. can be achieved with browserstack(company could have discount after reasonable negotiation :) )
